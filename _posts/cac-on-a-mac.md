In this video we will set up Windows virtual machine to run on top of your MacOS. This method is for the Intel based Macs, not the Apple Silicon Macs (such as the M1 chip). This is not duel booting the computer, I have found driver compatibility issue when duel booting so I prefer this method and it works every time. 
The how to in a nutshell for the technically inclined:

 1. Download VirtualBox for the VirtualBox website
 2. Download the Windows 10 disk image from Microsoft
 3. Install VirtualBox
 4. Set up a Windows virtual machine
 5. Install Windows on to the virtual machine
 6. Install the VirtualBox Guest Editions for Windows
 7. Plug in CAC reader and update driver
 8. Download and install root certificates from Military CAC (make sure you download the zip file)
 9. Log into your military email through Outlook Web Access (OWA)
 10. Install the S/MIME add-on
